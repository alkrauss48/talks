## Software Consulting
locally and nationally

This talk is <u>**not**</u> a pitch to use us

We are here as:
- Sales
- Creative
- Development

We have found **success**, and we want to share our tips with you

## Before the 30 days

1. What on earth can you deliver to a client in **only 30 days**?

2. How do you **manage expectations** with the client?
<small>(i.e. cost, the product, goals, vision)</small>

## The first 2 days

1. How do you **collaborate** with a client?

2. What if we **disagree** with a client's ideas?

## The other 28 days

1. How do you **build** things *fast*?

2. How do you handle **communication** and **feedback**?

## Finale

How do you plan for **future success**?

Thanks!
