Open Source Licenses
make it easier to
contribute

4 Main Concerns

* Modify
* Distribution
* Who has access
* Price

Common Open
Source Licenses

MIT
BSD
Apache

MIT

"It's free, use it
however you want,
just don't sue me"

Shortest & Broadest

You can actually sell
a product with MIT license

Only Requirement:
Can't take away the
license in your project

BSD

BSD 2 vs BSD 3

BSD 2 is very
similar to MIT

But, can't sell the original work

BSD 3 includes
non-endorsement clause

Means you can't use the original
contributors to endorse your derived
product

Apache

"Like MIT, but more accessible. And free."

* Project is free
* Anyone can use it
* Rights will always remain

Hardcore Open
Source Licenses

GPL

GPL
General Public License

The project must be free

You can:
* Copy
* Distribute
* Modify

The Caveat

It's Copylefted

"It's free. And your project will be too."

Bonus: LGPL

Not Open Source,
But Stil Free

Creative Commons

4 Parts

Can be used individually
or as a combination

Attribution
Share Alike (i.e. Copylefted)
Non-Commercial
No Deritive Works

Top 3 Licenses

MIT - 25%
GPL - 19%
Apache - 15%
