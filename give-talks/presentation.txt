How to Submit a
Conference Talk

1) Find a topic that
you want to learn about

Something that will
motivate you

And challenge you

Notice that I didn't say
"Need to be an expert in"

2) Match it with the
goals of the
conference

ThunderPlains

Mostly front-end

3) Do NOT worry
about writing the
whole talk beforehand

For me, I want to learn...

Svelte.js

Three.js

Accessibility

GitOps?

How to Submit

thunderplainsconf.com

tl;dr

When you submit
a conference talk

You're submitting an idea

Not a full talk

You have a while
to build that full talk

Thanks!
