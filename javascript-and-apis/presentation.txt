APIs

Application
Programming
Interface

APIs are used to integrate with
other services.

E.g. writing an application to
load all of your tweets.

Most APIs use HTTP

With HTTP, you can typically do 4 things

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

These map to actual HTTP "verbs"

* Create = POST
* Read = GET
* Update = PUT / PATCH
* Delete = DELETE

Most APIs will respond with some
form of common data format

Usually:
* JSON
* XML

Demo

Why use APIs?

Front-end Frameworks

* React
* Vue
* Angular

Single Page Apps
