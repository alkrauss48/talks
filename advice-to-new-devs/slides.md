## Software Consulting
locally and nationally

Technical Lead of New Development

What I do:

* Build web applications
* Build mobile applications
* Work with clients
* Manage people
* This

Our Stack:

* Laravel (PHP)
* Vue.js
* .NET
* Flutter
* Go

Plus some cool tools:

* Git
* Docker
* Kubernetes

My **3** pieces of advice
to being a new dev

\# 1

School isn't going to teach you everything

This field changes too much

School is a great foundation

But take that and **build something for yourself**, and let that be your guide

\# 2

**Networking** is really important

* make connections
* don't burn bridges
* attend events

\# 3

FAANG is cool, but so is **local**

Big tech companies pay more

They also may:
* lay off
* over work you
* expect you to leave after a couple years
* be fully remote
* not hire with growth in mind

Local companies still pay well

And they:
* hire you for the long-term
* care about you as a person
* focus on training and growth
* option of remote vs. in-office
* can be involved in local community
