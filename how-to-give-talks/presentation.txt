* How to prepare
* The talk
* Answering questions
* After the talk
* My Story
* Shirts!

* Shirts?

* Have an Idea

It can be anything

Your topic is good enough

It's all about learning

* Take the Plunge

Sign a check that you have to cash

If you keep wondering,
you'll never let yourself do it

After you do it, you'll be nervous

So, now what?

* Here's What to Expect

Or, not expect...

No one is expecting you to be an expert

"Every man I meet is my superior
in some way, and in that I learn
from him." - Emerson

We just want to learn something,
no matter how small

It's 100% okay to
say "I don't know"

* How to Prepare

Build an outline

Figure out how you want to present

Powerpoint, Google Docs,
slides.com, live coding?

Don't overwhelm yourself
the first time

Don't compare yourself to others

Compare yourself to you, and only you

Practice

Practice a couple times - but don't go crazy

You can practice in your head
at lunch, without speaking

Do NOT try to memorize a whole
presentation word-for-word

Everyone wants you to succeed

No one is critiquing your every word,
or trying to ask you impossible questions

* The Talk

The first minute is rough

After the first minute,
you feel a high

Be interactive

Don't sweat it; you know the material

Things will happen; just roll with it

Pro tip: keep an eye on the clock

It's always better to end
early than to end late

* Answering Questions

For every question,
you should start off
by thinking "I don't know"

If you do know it - great!

Admitting that you don't
know an answer is always okay

People respect honesty

But don't BS

* After the Talk

You'll feel all the nervousness gone

You'll feel so good

It's like another high

And then the best part...

You'll want to sign up for the next talk

People get to know you

They'll follow you
on social media

Post/tweet about you

Know you on the
Techlahoma slack

* My Story

Talks are fun for me b/c
I know I'm talking to my friends

Do I get nervous?

Absolutely - every time

But I have fun

2014 - First talk at OKCRB

2015 - Second talk at OKCRB

Several talks later...

* Bonus

You don't always have to give
a talk over something you know

Give a talk about
something you don't know

It forces you to learn something

Ansible/Packer/Terraform

* Shirts!

* Summary

Take the plunge.
You don't have to be an expert.
Everyone wants you to succeed.

Thanks!

* Take the plunge

1) Have an idea

It can be anything - literally anything tech-related.
Don't think that your idea isn't good enough - because it is. Even if it's a
tiny topic, you can give a talk. You can share knowledge with everyone, and
that's what it's all about.


2) Take the plunge
* Sign a check that you have to cash
* If you keep wondering, you'll never let yourself do it. You just have to say
"I'll do it," and go from there.
* After you do it, you'll be nervous

* So you're giving a talk, now what?

3) Here's what to Expect
* No one is expecting you to be an expert. No one expects you to be perfect.
* Emerson - "Every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn
  from him." You don't have to be all-around smarter than anyone else to teach
  them - because you will always know at least something that they don't know.
* We just want to learn something, no matter how small. If I can listen to you
  and learn a single fact that I didn't know before, then that's a win for me.
* It's 100% okay to say "I don't know." That's usually my response to questions.
  i.e. "I think..., but I don't know." It's very difficult to answer questions
  on the fly, and even when you do, you'll usually forget something. The best
  thing to do is to point the person to where they can learn more.


4) How to Prepare
* Build an outline
* Figure out how you want to present
* Powerpoint, Google Docs, slides.com, live coding?
  - Don't overwhelm yourself the first time. Pick something comfortable.
  - I know there's a desire to "impress" everyone - and looking at your favorite
    speakers give conf talks makes you think that even more - but don't compare
    yourself to them. Compare yourself to you, and only you.
* Practice.
  - Practice a couple times - but don't go crazy.
  - You can practice in your head at lunch - that's no biggie.
* Do NOT try to memorize a whole presentation word-for-word, or you will lose
  and won't have fun. Just remember the talking points.


Everyone wants you to succeed. No one is critiquing your every word, or trying
to ask you impossible questions. We all want you to do well, and we want to help
you. We're all on the same page.

5) The Talk
* The first minute is rough. You're warming up, doing your intro, and getting in
  the groove.
* After the first minute, you feel a high - and that's when you just rock and
  roll.
* Pro tip: keep an eye on the clock. It's always better to end early than to end
  late.


6) Answering Questions
* For every question, you should start off by thinking "I don't know". If you
  happen to know it off the top of your head, then you can answer. But it's
  always okay to say I don't know.
* Admitting that you don't know an answer is always okay. People will respect
  your honesty. They won't appreciate you BSing an answer - so try not to do
  that.


7) After the Talk
* you'll feel all the nervousness gone, and you'll feel so good.
* It's like a high.
* And then you'll want to sign up for the next talk
* People get to know you. They'll follow you on twitter, say hi to you more
  often at the user group meetups, and probably slack you saying you did a great
  job.


8) My Talk Path

* Talks are fun for me because I know that I'm talking to my friends, and not to
  people who will judge me. Do I get nervous? Absolutely - but it's fun. I have
  the opportunity to share something that I thought was cool with you all - and
  hopefully teach you something


Bonus:
* Give a talk about something that you don't know very well. This is what I try to
  do these days - because it teaches me.
* Talk about ansible/packer/terraform talk

Summary:
* Take the plunge
* You don't have to be an expert
* Everyone wants you to succeed

9) Shirts!
