Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques
to give computer systems the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.

But first, what is a neural network? The human brain consists of 100 billion
cells called neurons, connected together by synapses. If sufficient synaptic
inputs to a neuron fire, that neuron will also fire. We call this process “thinking”.

We can model the thinking process with matrix

Example has 3 input neurons, 1 hidden neuron, and 1 output neuron.

You might have noticed, that the output is always equal to the value of the leftmost input column.
Therefore the answer is the ‘?’ should be 1.

We will give each input a weight, which can be a positive or negative number.
An input with a large positive weight or a large negative weight,
will have a strong effect on the neuron’s output

Before we start, we set each weight to a random number. Then we begin the training process:

1) Take the inputs from a training set example, adjust them by the weights, and
   pass them through a special formula to calculate the neuron’s output.
2) Calculate the error, which is the difference between the neuron’s output and
   the desired output in the training set example.
3) Depending on the direction of the error, adjust the weights slightly.
4) Repeat this process 10, 000 times.

Eventually the weights of the neuron will reach an optimum for the training set.
If we allow the neuron to think about a new situation, that follows the same pattern,
it should make a good prediction.

This process is called back propagation.

numpy functions:
exp — the natural exponential
array — creates a matrix
dot — multiplies matrices
random — gives us random numbers

The ‘.T’ function, transposes the matrix from horizontal to vertical.
So the computer is storing the numbers like this.
