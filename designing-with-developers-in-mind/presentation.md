# Developer Code of Ethics
when working with a designer

\# 1

Even if you don't have to, *or even want to*...

You <u>must</u> always
deviate from the original design.

\# 2

At least once, say
*we can't do that*,
or even better:
**I'm not going to do that**.

\# 3

Get the project **90%** close to the original
design. After that, just say everything will
take too much time

ðŸ˜‚ Even if it won't! ðŸ˜‚

\# 4

Never admit that you don't know something.

Just say **it's impossible**, even if there
are plenty of websites that already do it.
