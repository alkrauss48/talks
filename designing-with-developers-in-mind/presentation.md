# Designing with Developers in Mind

But first...

# Developer Code of Ethics
when working with a designer

\# 1

Even if you don't have to, *or even want to*...

You <u>must</u> always
deviate from the original design.

\# 2

At least once, say
*we can't do that*,
or even better:
**I'm not going to do that**.

\# 3

Get the project **90%** close to the original
design. After that, just say everything will
take too much time

ðŸ˜‚ Even if it won't! ðŸ˜‚

\# 4

Never admit that you don't know something.

Just say **it's impossible**, even if there
are plenty of websites that already do it.

# Developer Code of Ethics
when working with a designer

Now that that's out of the way

# Designing with Developers in Mind

Core message:

Empowering you to collaborate with developers

* Pre-design
* Design
* Post-design
* Dev Phase

## Pre-design
2 points

\# 1

Review scope together

Usually this will be something like:

* contract
* statement of work
* list of requirements

\# 2

Diagram UX flows together

![Figjam workflow diagram](https://534d-2600-8803-bfba-3900-290d-e859-992d-8d11.ngrok-free.app/images/workflow-diagram.jpg)

This is **product design**

which should incorporate
both the **design** and the **build** teams

## Summary
Pre-design

1. Review scope together
1. Diagram UX flows together

## Design
3 points

\# 1

Review major design flows with dev lead

\# 2

Stateful design

It's typical to only design the "happy path"

As developers, we have to know what to do
when things are different "states"

* initial
* loading
* error
* success

![Error with retry](https://534d-2600-8803-bfba-3900-290d-e859-992d-8d11.ngrok-free.app/images/error-retry.png)

\# 3

Gloss over the right things

You don't have to design everything

But there are some things you should always design

You can skip designing:

* 10 of the same page template
* screens with minor differences
* stateful design for *everything*

But you *should* design:

* all different components/widgets
* one example of various states
* responsive designs

On the topic of responsive design...

\# 4

Try to keep responsive designs the same

Navigation can be an exception

But in general, keep the same UX

We don't have separate codebases for
different screen sizes

It is okay to deviate, as long as you
have a good reason

## Summary
Design

1. Review major design flows with dev lead
1. Diagram UX flows together
1. Gloss over the right things
1. Try to keep responsive designs the same

## Post-design
2 points

\# 1

Review designs together

\# 2

Express what is ultra important, and what isn't

![Mobile app with pie chart](https://534d-2600-8803-bfba-3900-290d-e859-992d-8d11.ngrok-free.app/images/what-is-important.jpg)

## Summary
Post-design

1. Review designs together
1. Express what is ultra important, and what isn't

## Dev Phase
3 points

\# 1

If you change the design, communicate

\# 2

Check in with the dev team

Things happen during dev

Know that you can play a role in determining direction

\# 3

Know that designs won't identically match the final product

Business > Design or Dev

That means:

* Client adjustments
* Deadlines
* Budget
* Resource availability

That said, the devs have a responsibility
to communicate deviations

## Summary
Dev Phase

1. If you change the design, communicate
1. Check in with the dev team
1. Know that designs won't identically match the final product
