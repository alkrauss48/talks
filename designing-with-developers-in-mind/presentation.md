# Designing with Developers in Mind

But first...

# Developer Code of Ethics
when working with a designer

\# 1

Even if you don't have to, *or even want to*...

You <u>must</u>
deviate from the original design.

\# 2

At least once, say
*we can't do that*,
or even better:
**I'm not going to do that**.

\# 3

Get the project **90%** close to the original
design. After that, just say everything will
take too much time

ðŸ˜‚ Even if it won't! ðŸ˜‚

\# 4

Never admit that you don't know something.

Just say **it's impossible**, even if there
are plenty of examples that already do it.

# Developer Code of Ethics
when working with a designer

Now that that's out of the way

# Designing with Developers in Mind

Why have this talk?

I've worked closely with
designers since 2014

We like to blame each other

To a degree, I get it

Usually design and dev don't happen together

Which means there's often no collaboration

Design builds this vision

Dev decides how to implement it

We can do better

Core message:

Empowering you to **collaborate** with developers

Not just while you're designing

But before and after too

* Pre-design
* Design
* Post-design
* Dev Phase

## Pre-design
2 points

\# 1

Review scope together

Usually this will be something like:

* contract
* statement of work
* list of requirements

\# 2

Diagram UX flows together

![Figjam workflow diagram](https://github.com/alkrauss48/talks/blob/master/designing-with-developers-in-mind/images/workflow-diagram.jpg?raw=true)

This is **product design**

which should incorporate
both the **design** and the **dev** teams

## Summary
Pre-design

1. Review scope together
1. Diagram UX flows together

## Design
3 points

\# 1

Review major design decisions with dev lead

\# 2

Stateful design

Often we focus on designing the "success path"

As developers, we have to know what to do
when things are different "states"

* initial
* loading
* error
* success

\# 3

Gloss over the right things

You don't have to design everything

But there are some things you should always design

You don't have to design:

* 10 of the same page template

* screens with minor differences

* stateful design for *everything*

But you *should* design:

* all different components/widgets

* one example of various states

* responsive designs

\# 4

Follow patterns, and only deviate for good reasons

Example questions a dev might ask:

Why are there 8 shades of gray throughout the app?

Why are these 3 page headers the same, but this other one is different?

Why does this button open a modal, but the other takes you to a page?

Why is this experience different on mobile than on desktop?

As developers, we like to find patterns

We don't like handling edge cases

It is okay to deviate from your patterns, as long as you
have a good reason

Just make sure you have a good reason

And communicate that reason

## Summary
Design

1. Review major design flows with dev lead
1. Diagram UX flows together
1. Gloss over the right things
1. Follow patterns

## Post-design
2 points

\# 1

Review designs together

\# 2

Express what is ultra important, and what isn't

![Mobile app with pie chart](https://github.com/alkrauss48/talks/blob/master/designing-with-developers-in-mind/images/what-is-important.jpg?raw=true)

## Summary
Post-design

1. Review designs together
1. Express what is ultra important, and what isn't

## Dev Phase
3 points

\# 1

If you change the design, communicate

\# 2

Check in with the dev team

Requirements often change during dev

Know that you can play a role in determining direction

\# 3

Know that designs won't identically match the final product

Plato's Theory of Forms

Business > Design or Dev

That means:

* Client adjustments
* Deadlines
* Budget
* Resource availability

That said, the devs have a responsibility
to communicate deviations

## Summary
Dev Phase

1. If you change the design, communicate
1. Check in with the dev team
1. Know that designs won't identically match the final product
