# Intro to Programming

In this talk, I review what itâ€™s like to be a developer, my day-to-day, when you
would use different languages, some basics that all programming languages have
(variables, looping, functions, etc.), important aspects of coding in a team
environment, and then segue into an overview about some the more common
strategies of programming: object-oriented, procedural, and functional.
