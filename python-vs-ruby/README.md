Python vs Ruby
---
By [@thecodeboss](https://twitter.com/thecodeboss)

Python and Ruby share a lot of similarities both syntactically and by design -
probably moreso than most other common languages you hear about today - but
they're clearly different languages with different ways of doing things.

In this talk, you'll hear Aaron Krauss (aka "The Ruby Guy") talk about how Ruby
works compared to Python. Most of the presentation will be live-coding driven,
and if you have specific questions about how Ruby works, Aaron will be more
than happy to interactively answer them and code them out. This talk will be
completely unbiased - which means you should come with that mentality in mind
as well! Neither Ruby nor Python are "better" than the other - they're just
different, and that's what we'll be focusing on!

Aaron Krauss is a developer at Clevyr where he builds data-driven applications
and games in Javascript, .NET, Ruby, Shell, and anything else awesome. He also
blogs regularly, enjoys craft beer, has a cool dog, and has been dating someone
for over 10 years.
