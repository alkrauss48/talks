How to be a good
dev on a team

Sneak Peek:
Not a lot of it has
to do with actual coding

3 concepts

1) Know that your code will
be viewed by other people

Sometimes decades later

* Comment code

* Label things appropriately

* Whitespace your code

2) Communicate

* The good things
* The bad things

* Communicate about progress,
roadblocks, deadlines, concerns,
ideas, etc.

* No limit on who to communicate with

* Bosses
* Coworkers
* Subordinates

* Caveat: don't gossip

3) Play a role in
non-dev processes

* At first as a junior dev,
just try to complete the
tasks that you are given.

* As you become more comfortable though,
you can help give feedback with:

* Sales
* Project Management
* Design
* And more

Being a developer is a unique
perspective that only you can offer

And that feedback is valuable to
the rest of the business

Don't make demands. Just give feedback.

tl;dr

It's not your job to only sit and code.
It's your job to contribute to the business.

Business drives development,
and not the other way around.
