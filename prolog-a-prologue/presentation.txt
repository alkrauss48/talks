What is Prolog?
# Prolog was created in 1972 by Alain Colmerauer, and it's a logic programming
# language - a set of sentences expressing facts and rules.

It's not Functional

Logical Programming

A set of sentences in logical form,
expressing facts and rules about some
problem domain.

So...

What's a
Declarative
Language?

Imperative Languages

Where you tell the compiler
(or interpreter) what to do

Java
JavaScript
Ruby
C#
Python
PHP
etc.

Isn't that how ALL programming works?

Not Always

Declarative Languages

Where you describe to the compiler
(or interpreter) what you want - but not
exactly how to do it

How Prolog Works

▸ Facts
▸ Rules
▸ Queries

You define a Knowledge Base
And then you query it

Commonly used today for natural language processing

Takeaways

Prolog is powerful when used
in the right situation

It's silly when used in
the wrong situation
