=== Setup

First get yourself setup with link:http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/[virtualenv] so we don't break any other Python stuff you have on your machine. After you've got that installed let's setup an environment for our app:

[source]
----
$ virtualenv neo4j-movies
$ source neo4j-movies/bin/activate
----

The next step is to install the dependencies for the app:

[source]
----
(neo4j-movies)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----

=== Run locally

Start your local Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]), open the http://localhost:7474[Neo4j Browser]. 
Then install the Movies data-set with `:play movies`, click the statement, and hit the triangular "Run" button.

And finally let's start up a Flask web server:

[source]
----
(neo4j-movies)$ export NEO4J_PASSWORD="my-password"
(neo4j-movies)$ python movies.py
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/
----

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you should see your first Neo4j application
