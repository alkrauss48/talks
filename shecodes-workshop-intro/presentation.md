My goals:

1 - Pump you up to give a talk

2 - Debunk your fears about it

Why Give Talks?

2 reasons

1. To learn and teach

2. Market yourself

That also includes
your demographic

Look at me

I'm your stereotype

My demographic has
been in charge far
too long

We've made things:

- narrow-minded
- ego-driven
- we talk about ping pong and craft beer far too much

Meanwhile, from other
demographics at Clevyr:

* listen first, then speak
* ask the right questions
* more emphasis on the user

You shouldn't just *have*
a voice at the table

You should <span style="color: red;">**be**</span> the
voice at the table

Let's break
down the barriers

5 common fears

Fear #1:
My topic isn't good enough

Your topic is good enough

It's all about learning

"Every man I meet is my superior
in some way, and in that I learn
from him." - Emerson

If I learn one thing from
you, it's a win

Fear #2:
I'll never feel ready

This one's probably true

There's a difference
between **feeling** ready,
and **being** ready

Sign up for a talk

If you keep thinking about it,
you'll never let yourself do it

After you sign up, you'll be nervous

Everyone always is

Practice to the point where
you don't want to practice anymore

Fear #3:
I'll freeze up

Accept that things will happen

Just roll with it

The first minute is rough

After the first minute,
you get in the zone

Everyone wants you to succeed

Fear #4:
I can't speak
for 30-40 minutes

That's okay

Shorter is better

Everybody prefers to
get done early

Fear #5:
I won't be able to
answer questions

"I don't know" is
a valid answer

No one is expecting you to be an expert

People respect honesty

They don't like BS

Summary

* Your topic is good enough
* Sign up before you feel ready
* Everyone wants you to succeed
* Shorter is better
* "I don't know" is okay
