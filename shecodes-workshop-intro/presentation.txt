Agenda

* Have an idea

* What to expect
* How to prepare
* The talk
* Answering questions
* After the talk
* My Story

* Have an Idea

It can be anything

Your topic is good enough

It's all about learning

* Take the Plunge

Sign up for a talk

If you keep thinking about it,
you'll never let yourself do it

After you sign up, you'll be nervous

Everyone always is

So, now what?

* Here's What to Expect

Or, not expect...

No one is expecting you to be an expert

"Every man I meet is my superior
in some way, and in that I learn
from him." - Emerson

We just want to learn something,
no matter how small

You're just talking
to your friends

* How to Prepare

Build a short outline

Figure out how you want to present

Powerpoint, Google Slides,
walk through your code, etc.

Don't overwhelm yourself
the first time

Don't compare yourself to others

Compare yourself to you, and only you

Practice

Practice a few times - but don't go crazy

Practice to the point where
you don't want to practice anymore

You can practice in your
head, without speaking

Do NOT try to memorize a whole
presentation word-for-word

Memorize your talking flow

Everyone wants you to succeed

No one is critiquing your every word,
or trying to ask you impossible questions

* The Talk

The first minute is rough

After the first minute,
you get in the zone

Be interactive

Don't sweat it; you know the material

Things will happen; just roll with it

Pro tip: keep an eye on the clock

It's always better to end
early than to end late

* Answering Questions

For every question,
I like to start
by thinking "I don't know"

If you do know it - great!

Admitting that you don't
know an answer is always okay

People respect honesty

They don't like BS

* After the Talk

You'll feel all the nervousness gone

You'll feel so good

It feels like you
just won Wimbledon

And then the best part...

You'll want to sign up for the next talk

People get to know you

They'll follow you
on social media

Post/tweet/threads? about you

Know you on the
Techlahoma slack

* My Story

2014 - First talk at OKCRB

Talks are fun for me b/c
I know I'm talking to my friends

Do I get nervous?

Absolutely - every time

But I have fun

* Summary

Your topic is good enough
Take the plunge
Short outline + practice
Everyone wants you to succeed
Shorter > Longer

Thanks!
