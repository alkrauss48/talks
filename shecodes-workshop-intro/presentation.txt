I've spoken quite
a bit

Do I get nervous?

Absolutely - every time

But I have fun

Why Give Talks?

1. To learn and teach

2. Market yourself

How to give your
first talk

* Have an idea
* Take the plunge
* How to prepare
* The talk
* Answering questions
* After the talk

* Have an Idea

It can be anything

Your topic is good enough

It's all about learning

* Take the Plunge

Sign up for a talk

If you keep thinking about it,
you'll never let yourself do it

After you sign up, you'll be nervous

Everyone always is

So, now what?

* How to Prepare

No one is expecting you to be an expert

"Every man I meet is my superior
in some way, and in that I learn
from him." - Emerson

We just want to learn something,
no matter how small

You're just talking
to your friends

Build a short outline

Figure out how you want to present

Powerpoint, Google Slides,
walk through your code, etc.

Don't overwhelm yourself
the first time

Don't compare yourself to others

Compare yourself to you, and only you

Practice

Practice a few times - but don't go crazy

Practice to the point where
you don't want to practice anymore

You can practice in your
head, without speaking

Focus on your talking flow,
don't memorize your entire
talk word-for-word

* The Talk

The first minute is rough

After the first minute,
you get in the zone

Be interactive

Things will happen; just roll with it

Everyone wants you to succeed

Pro tip: keep an eye on the clock

It's always better to end
early than to end late

* Answering Questions

"I don't know" is
a valid answer

People respect honesty

They don't like BS

* After the Talk

You'll feel all the nervousness gone

It feels like you
just won Wimbledon

And then the best part...

You'll want to sign up for the next talk

* Summary

* Your topic is good enough
* Sign up before you feel ready
* Practice until you don't want to
* Everyone wants you to succeed
* Shorter is better
