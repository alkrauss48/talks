ETL Pipelines

Write =

* Insert

Live Demo

Quick Intro into Laravel

Our ETL Demo

OldStore -> Item
OldItem -> Item

How to Improve

0. Track metrics

1. Implement bulk queries

2. Keep logic flat

3. Write only as needed

Writes are more expensive
than Reads for two reasons:

* You're writing to a file
* You're breaking database cache

4. Implement database indexing

Done

Takeaways:

0. Track metrics
1. Implement bulk queries
2. Keep logic flat
3. Write only as needed
4. Implement database indexing

Big Takeaway:

None of this only
applies to ETL!

You can use these
concepts in all of
your data-driven projects
